            <p class="article__text">"<strong>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</strong>" is a <strong>science
                    fiction</strong> novel first published in 1968.
                It was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">In this novel, we follow Rick Deckard, an <strong>android</strong> hunter.
                The plot is supposed to take place in the early 1990s, but we now know that the
                world depicted there is much more <strong>futuristic</strong> than the actual one we live in.
            </p>

            <h2>The world after a nuclear conflict</h2>
            <p class="article__text">After a devastating nuclear war, the Earth is now covered with radioactive dust.
                Almost the entire population has migrated to space colonies like Mars.
                There, everyone is entitled to their own <a class="annotation" href="glossary.html#android">android</a>
                slave, a near perfect replica of a human.

            <p class="article__text">The few individuals left on earth may at any time be declared “special”.
                This means that their genetic heritage has been deteriorated due to the
                radioactive dust, and they are forbidden to have offspring.
                "Emigrate or degenerate" is a sentence from the book.
                Understandably, that this is a strong argument to encourage the last stubborn
                ones to leave the Earth.

            <q class="article__simple-quote">A humanoid robot is no different from any other machine. It can go from
                good to bad in the blink of an eye.</q>

            <h2>Is hunting androids a vocation?</h2>
            <p class="article__text">Rick works on Earth and therefore cannot emigrate.
                His job is to find androids that arrived on Earth after escaping from the colonies.
                Then, he gets rid of them.
                Rick is rather bored with his job, it's a non-interesting routine.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">But when Holden, the best android hunter in the San Francisco Police Department,
                is sent to the hospital by an android, Rick takes a chance.
                He takes over Holden's mission, hoping he will collect the bounty for
                eliminating not one android, but six.
                However, this will require him to outdo himself, and question many aspects of his reality.

            <h2>Empathy, the key to this altered world</h2>
            <p class="article__text">What distinguish androids from humans is their inability to feel <a

                The Voight-Kampff is a test of empathy that Rick uses to detect androids.
                Humans are also invited to cultivate their empathy.
                There are two ways to do this, which we will see below.

            <p class="article__text">Firstly via the empathy box, where they can connect to a mythical character, Wilbur
                Mercer.
                Mercer has to climb an endless hill while stones are thrown at him, like a

            </figure>
            <p class="article__text">Rick is brought to ask himself many existential questions, as this extract on pages
                160-161 shows.</p>
            <blockquote class="article__blockquote">
                - There's an anomaly in your empathic reactions.
                Something we don't have a test for.
                Your feelings towards androids.<br>
                - Of course there's no test for that.<br>
                - Maybe we should conceive one.<br>
                Rick had never thought about it before.
                He himself had never felt any empathy for the androids he killed.
                He had always assumed that his subconscious perceived an android as an
                intelligent
                machine - in the same way as his conscience.
                And yet, unlike Phil Resch, the two had come to diverge.
                And he felt instinctively that he was right.<br>
                Empathy for an artificial construct?
                For something that only pretends to live?
                But Luba Luft had seemed perfectly alive to him, without the slightest trace of
                simulation.

            <p class="article__text">Secondly, by being the proud owner of an animal.
                In fact, the animals have almost all disappeared, and the few remaining species
                are extremely expensive.
                A catalogue, the Sydney, lists each month the different animals available for
                sale and their prices.
                For the more modest ones who still want to make a good impression, a near
                perfect electric replica of an animal can be purchased at a lower price.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">At the beginning of the novel, Rick owns an electric sheep, hence the title of
                the book.
                However, he had a real sheep before, which got sick and died.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">Then, with to the bounties he received for removing six androids, he buys a real
                goat. This one is then killed by Rachel Rosen, an android.
                Finally, he finds an electric toad in a deserted place and decides to keep it.

                The bounty for the removal of five droids would do the trick, he then realized.
                A thousand dollars a head, on top of my salary.
                Then all I have to do is find someone willing to sell me what I want.
                Even if the price is in italics in the Sydney.
                Five thousand dollars - but first five androids would have to decide to arrive
                on Earth from one of the colonies, and that's not up to me.<br>
                And even if I could get them here, there are other bounty hunters, other police
                forces around the world.<br>
                Droids would have to move to Northern California, and the area's top bounty
                hunter, Dave Holden, would have to die or retire.
